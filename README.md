### Description

An example of how even with just API calls and some simple math, you can have a lot going on in your game and create some neat effects. Sorry, not much for comments in the code. This example does not incorporate collision detection, but it's a starting point for further development.

By the way, if you press "L" or "K" you can activate/de-activate a triple shot feature for the bottom ship ("B" or "N" for the top ship)
